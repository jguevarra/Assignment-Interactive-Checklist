## **Project:** Universal Assignment Calendar ##

The purpose of this project is to create a calendar that will store and display all class assignments and important dates, such as exam and quiz dates and office hours. Unlike in UVA collab, where one must make multiple clicks to find the due dates of their assignments, this calendar will have everything in one place.

We envision our web app to have a simple design like ScheduleMe, with some functionality to the crowd sourcing functionality of the GPS app, Waze. Students and professors can post on the calendar and rate the legitimacy of the post and information.
